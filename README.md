# Bristol Open SDG - Site Repository
![Staging](https://github.com/sdg-bristol/sdg-site-bristol/actions/workflows/deploy-to-staging.yml/badge.svg)  
This repository holds the site configuration for the Bristol SDG indicators.  
The main site for viewing these indicators is accessible through the following link: [Bristol Open SDG](https://bristolsdgs.github.io/).  

The Development (work in progress) version of the site is accessible through the following link: [WIP-Bristol Open SDG](https://sdg-bristol.github.io/sdg-site-bristol/).  
Note: The development site may contain changes that are not finalised and thus may not make it to the production version of the site  

This is a starter repository to help in implementing the [Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) platform. [See here for documentation](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io).
